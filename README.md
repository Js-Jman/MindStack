## 🏗 Project Architecture

The project follows a modular and scalable architecture structure:



```
app/              → Routing & Layouts (Next.js)
components/       → Reusable UI Components
services/         → Business Logic Layer
repositories/     → Database Access Layer
lib/              → Utilities & Config
hooks/            → Custom React Hooks
types/            → TypeScript Types
prisma/           → Database Schema
middleware.ts     → Role-based Route Protection
```

### Architectural Principles

- Clear separation of concerns
- Feature-based modular structure
- Service → Repository → Database flow
- Role-based access control
- Reusable UI component system

This ensures maintainability, scalability, and clean code organization.

## 🔐 Role-Based Access Control

The system supports:

- Student
- Instructor
- Admin

Routes and dashboards are protected using middleware and server-side authorization checks to ensure secure access control.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Js-Jman/MindStack.git
cd MindStack
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

---

### 3️⃣ Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```env
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/mindstack"

# Environment
NODE_ENV=development

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Replace `user`, `password`, and database name with your actual MySQL credentials.

---

### 4️⃣ Database Setup with Prisma

First, generate the Prisma client:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

Then push the schema to your database:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

Finally, seed the database with dummy data:

```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```

Or run all steps at once:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
